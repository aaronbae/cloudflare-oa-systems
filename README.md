# cloudflare-oa-systems

This project was to create a Systems tool to measure the speed of the website I created through Cloudflare-OA project. However, because of the requirement that I cannot use a pre-existing HTTP library, I was not able to complete the goal. The submission for the OA was done without this part of the project.
